Hi there! I am a former quantitative researcher interested in deep learning. I graduated from UNSW with a double degree in mathematics and actuarial studies where my interests in financial maths and software development lead me to working in quantitative finance for two years. In my spare time, I enjoy reading (particularly about productivity), playing the piano and various sports such as tennis, running and swimming.
