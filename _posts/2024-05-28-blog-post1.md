Today, let's look at short expected value problem involving a die.

> What is the expected number of rolls until a 6 is rolled given that all rolls are even?

Let \\(N\\) be the number of rolls required to see a \\(6\\) (inclusive) and \\(A\\) be the event that all the rolls are even. If all rolls are even and we stop when a \\(6\\) is rolled, each of the previous rolls must be either a \\(2\\) or \\(4\\). Thus, 

$$
    \begin{align*}
        E[N|A] 
        & = \frac{E[N1_{A}]}{\Pr(A)} \\
        & = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n \Pr(N = n \cap A)}{\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{6}\cdot \left(\frac{2}{6}\right)^{n-1}} \\
        & = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n \cdot \frac{1}{3}\cdot \left(\frac{2}{6}\right)^{n-1}}{\frac{1}{6}\cdot\frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{3}}}.
    \end{align*}
$$

Observe that the numerator contains a series of the form \\(S = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} nx^{n-1}\\) where \\(\|x\| < 1\\). A standard approach is to use differentiation and interchange with the sum. However, personally I prefer the following more intuitive derivation:

$$
    \begin{align*}
        & S = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + \ldots \\
        \implies & xS  = \quad\hspace{0.3cm} x + 2x^2 + \ldots \\
        \implies & S(1 -x) = 1 + x + x^2 + \ldots \\
        \implies & S = \frac{1}{(1-x^2)}.
    \end{align*}
$$

Thus, we have

$$
    E[N|A] = \frac{\frac{1}{6}\cdot \frac{1}{(1 - \frac{1}{3})^2}}{\frac{1}{6}\cdot\frac{3}{2}} = \frac{3}{2}.
$$
