Today, we look at another interesting problem that applies [Random Walks II](https://browniannotion.github.io/posts/2024/05/14/blog-post-1/). This problem requires a little more creativity in defining the appropriate random walk processes to arrive at the solution.

> Suppose there are \\(n\\) balls in a bag of \\(n\\) different colours which we'll call \\(1,2,\ldots n\\) for convenience. Every turn, we randomly draw a pair of differently coloured balls and the second ball is painted with the colour of the first. Find the expected number of turns required for all the balls have the same colour. 

Let \\(\tau\\) be the number of steps until all balls have the same colour and \\(N_i\\) be the number of times a ball of colour \\(i\in\\{1,2,\ldots, n\\}\\) is chosen as part of the pair. Since we choose a pair of differently coloured balls each turn, \\(\tau = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i\\).

Now, define the processes \\(\\{X^{i}\_t\\}_{t=0}^{\infty}\\), where \\(X_t^{i}\\) is the number of balls of colour \\(i\\) on the \\(t^{\text{th}}\\) time that the colour \\(i\\) is chosen. Notice that with this definition of time, \\(X_t^{i}\\) become symmetric random walks starting at \\(1\\), as on each turn the color is chosen, the number of balls with that colour is equally likely to increase or decrease by \\(1\\). Furthermore, we observe that \\(N_i\\) measures the number of steps taken by \\(X_t^{i}\\) to reach either \\(0\\) or \\(n\\). From [Random Walks II](https://browniannotion.github.io/posts/2024/05/14/blog-post-1/), \\(E[N_i] = n-1\\), thus

$$
    E[\tau] = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[N_i] = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}.
$$
