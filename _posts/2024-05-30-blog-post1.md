Today, we'll explore a simple application of the reflection property of symmetric random walks.

The desired probability can be found by counting the number of relevant paths. Let \\(N_{a,b}\\) be the number of paths of a symmetric random walk that begin at \\(a\\), pass through \\(0\\) and end at \\(b\\) for integers \\(a,b\\). Observe that passing through \\(0\\) is a sufficient and necessary condition for the running minimum to be no more than \\(0\\). Then

$$
       \Pr\left(\min_{0\leq m \leq n} W_m \leq 0, W_n = b\right) 
       = \frac{N_{a,b}}{2^{n}}.
$$

Let \\(u\\), \\(d\\) be the number of up and down jumps made by \\(W\\) respectively. Note that these must be unique as they satisfy the following equations:

$$
    \begin{align*}
        u + d & = n \\
        u - d & = b - a \\
    \end{align*}
$$

Adding the equations yields \\(u = \frac{n + b - a}{2}\\). However, \\(u\\) must be a positive integer, so unless \\(2 \| n + b - a\\), then the desired probability is zero. Suppose that \\(2 \| n + b -a\\). The number of paths at begin at \\(a\\) and end at \\(b\\) is given by  \\(\binom{n}{\frac{n+b-a}{2}}\\).

By the reflection property, every path that we are interested in has a corresponding path that begins at \\(-a\\), visits \\(0\\) and ends at \\(b\\), produced by reflecting the part of the path from \\(a\\) to the first time the random walk hits \\(0\\) about the \\(x\\)-axis.

Thus, \\(N_{a,b} = N_{-a, b}\\) and we conclude that 

$$
    \Pr\left(\min_{0\leq m \leq n} W_m \leq 0, W_n = b\right) 
    = \frac{N_{-a, b}}{2^n} = 
    \begin{cases}
        \binom{n}{\frac{n + b + a}{2}}/{2^n} & \quad \text{if } 2 | n + b + a\\[1em]
        0 & \quad \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
$$

It is an easy exercise to check that \\(2 \| n+b-a\\) if and only if \\(2 \| n+b+a\\).
