Short post for today and an extension of yesterday's problem.

> Let \\(a\\), \\(b\\) be positive integers. Find the expected time that symmetric random walk starting at the origin first reaches \\(-a\\) or \\(b\\). 

Reusing the notation and definitions from the previous post, let \\(X\\) be an origin starting symmetric random walk and \\(\tau\\) be the time taken to reach either \\(-a\\) or \\(b\\). 

A standard technique of finding the stopping time associated with a random walk is to find a martingale that relates the random walk with the deterministic process \\(\\{n\\}_{n=0}^{\infty}\\), and then apply the Optional Stopping Theorem. Let \\(M_n = X_n^2 - n\\). We prove this is a martingale. (readers familiar with stochastic calculus may notice the analogue with Brownian Motion, where \\(W_t^2 - t\\) is a martingale). It can easily be checked that \\(M\\) is integrable. Furthermore, for integers \\(n\geq 1\\),

$$
    \begin{align*}
        E[M_n|\mathcal{F}_{n-1}] 
        & = E[(X_{n-1} + Z_{n})^2|\mathcal{F}_{n-1}] - n\\
        & = X_{n-1}^2 + 2X_{n-1}E[Z_{n}] + E[Z_{n}^2] - n \\
        &\quad \text{as }X_{n-1}\text{ is }\mathcal{F}_{n-1}\text{ measurable and }Z_n \text{ is independent of }Z_n \\
        & = X_{n-1}^2 - (n-1) \\
        & = M_{n-1}.
    \end{align*}
$$

From the previous post, we know that \\(\tau\\) is almost surely finite. Thus, applying the Optional Stopping Theorem,

$$
    \begin{align*}
        & E[M_{\tau}]  = E[M_0] = 0 \\
        \iff & E[\tau] = E[X_{\tau}^2]  \\
        \iff & E[\tau] = a^2 \Pr(A) + b^2 \Pr(B) \\
    \end{align*}
$$

From the previous post, we know that \\(\Pr(A) = \frac{b}{a+b}, \quad \Pr(B) = \frac{a}{a+b}\\). Hence, \\(E[\tau] = ab\\).
