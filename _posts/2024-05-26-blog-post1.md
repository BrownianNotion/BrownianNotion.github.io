Let's take a break from stochastic processes and explore a neat problem in geometric probability.

> Choose three points independently and uniformly on a circle. What is the probability that they form an acute triangle?

If we draw some diagrams, we will notice that when the three points are placed in the same semicircle, then the triangle's largest angle must be at least \\(90^{\circ}\\) and therefore cannot be acute.

Thus, it is enough to find the probability \\(p\\) that all points must lie in the same semicircle and take the complement. Consider \\(n\\) independent points uniformly chosen around a circle, and let \\(A_k\\), \\(k=1,2,\ldots, n\\) be the event that all \\(n\\) points lie inside the semicircle starting at point \\(k\\), where we order the points clockwise around the circle. Notice that \\(A_k\\) are disjoint since the clockwise angle between point \\(k\\) and the previous point must be greater than \\(180^{\circ}\\).

Once we have fixed the first point, the probability that the remaining points lie in the same semicircle is simply \\(\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\\), thus

$$
    \begin{align*}
        p = \sum_{k=1}^{n}\Pr(A_k) = \frac{n}{2^{n-1}}.
    \end{align*}
$$

Hence, the probability that the three points form an acute triangle is \\(1 - \frac{3}{2^{3-1}} = \frac{1}{4}\\).
