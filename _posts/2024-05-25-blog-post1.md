Today, we will prove a surprising long-term property of the path symmetric random walks.

> Let \\(X\\) be a symmetric random walk starting at the origin. What is the probability that the random walk returns to the origin?

Let \\(p_k\\) be the probability that the random walk starting at integer \\(k\\) will eventually visit the origin. Then,

$$
    \begin{align*}
        p_0 & = \Pr(X_1 = 1)\cdot p_1 + \Pr(X_1 = -1) \cdot p_{-1} = p_1,
        \end{align*}
$$

where \\(p_1 = p_{-1}\\) by symmetry as for every path that eventually hits \\(1\\), we can flip each step so that the path hits \\(-1\\) instead. 

Let \\(A\\) be the event that \\(X\\) never reaches \\(1\\) and \\(E_n\\) be the event that \\(X\\) reaches \\(-n\\) before \\(1\\) for some positive integer \\(n\\) . From [Random Walks I](https://browniannotion.github.io/posts/2024/05/13/blog-post-1/), we know that \\(X\\) must hit either \\(1\\) or \\(-n\\) in finite time, so \\(A = A\cap E_n\\). Hence, 

$$
    \begin{align*}
        \Pr(A)
        & = \Pr(A\cap E_n) \\
        & \leq \Pr(E_n) \\
        & = \frac{1}{n+1} \quad \text{using the result from Random Walks I.}
    \end{align*}
$$

As the above is true for all postive integers \\(n\\), \\(\Pr(A) = 0\\) and therefore \\(p_1 = 1\\). That is, a symmetric random walk starting at the origin is guaranteed to return there, and by extension, any symmetric random walk must return to its starting point.
