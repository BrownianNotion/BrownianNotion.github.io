So far in this series on random walk, we've considered problems in pairs - in each scenario, we've calculated both a probability and an expected value related to a stopping rule. Today, we will revisit the problem of a random walk returning to the origin and find the expected number of steps required to do so. The result may surprise you.

> Find the expected number of steps required for a symmetric random walk starting at the origin to return there.

For convenience, let's first define some notation. Let \\(\tau\\) be the number of steps taken for the random walk to return to the origin,  \\(\tau_{m, n}\\) be the number of steps taken for a random walk starting at \\(m\\) to hit \\(n\\) for integers \\(m,n\\) and \\(E[\tau_{m, n}] = x_{m, n}\\) . As the first step must be \\(+1\\) or \\(-1\\),

$$
    E[\tau] = \frac{1}{2}(1+x_{1, 0}) + \frac{1}{2}(1 + x_{-1, 0}).
$$

Consider the path of a random walk that begins at \\(1\\) and visits \\(0\\). Negating each step and shifting down by 1 yields a path that begins at \\(0\\) and visits \\(1\\). Thus, as the walks are symmetric, \\(x_{1, 0} = x_{0, 1}\\).

Using the result from [Random Walks II](https://browniannotion.github.io/posts/2024/05/14/blog-post-1/),

$$
    x_{0, 1} =E[\tau_{0,1}]\geq E[\min(\tau_{0,1}, \tau_{0, -n})] = n
$$

for all positive integers \\(n\\). Hence, \\(x_{0,1}\\) and therefore \\(E[\tau]\\) must both be infinite. This leads us to slightly counterintuitive result that although the random walk is guaranteed to return to the origin, the expected number of steps required to do so is infinite.
