Today, we have another nice problem involving random walks on a circle, this time extending the ideas from [Random Walks II](https://browniannotion.github.io/posts/2024/05/14/blog-post-1/).

> Label \\(n\\) points around a circle \\(0, 1, \ldots, n-1\\). Suppose we have a symmetric random walk on this circle starting at \\(0\\). Find the expected number of steps taken for the random walk to visit every point. 

This problem is a straightforward extension of the idea in Random Walks II. The key observation is that immediately after the \\(k^{\text{th}}\\) point is visited, where \\(k=1, \ldots, n-1\\), the number of steps until the next unique point is given by number of steps until the an origin starting symmetric random walk on the number line hits either \\(1\\) or \\(-k\\), which denote this by \\(\tau_{-k,1}\\). As an example, consider the diagram below for the case of \\(6\\) points where the walk has visited \\(0,1,5\\) where \\(1\\) was the last unique point visited. We require either a step clockwise to reach point \\(2\\) or three steps anti-clockwise to reach point \\(4\\).

Letting \\(\tau\\) be the time until the random walk has visited all points, we have 

$$
    \begin{align*}
        E[\tau] 
        & = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} E[\text{steps until }k+1\text{th}\text{ point} | \text{just visited k points}] \\ 
        & = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} E[\tau_{-k, 1}] \\
        & = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k \quad \text{using Random Walks II} \\
        & = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}.
    \end{align*}
$$
