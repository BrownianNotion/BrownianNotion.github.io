Now that we know why the Optional Stopping Theorem works, we can return to interesting random walk problems. Today's problem will extend the ideas used in [Random Walks I](https://browniannotion.github.io/posts/2024/05/13/blog-post-1/).

> Label \\(n\\) points around a circle \\(0, 1, \ldots, n-1\\). Suppose we have a symmetric random walk on this circle starting at \\(0\\) - that is at each timestep, the walk is equally likely to move one step clockwise or anti-clockwise and this is independent of all past moves. Suppose the walk terminates when each of the points on the circle has been visited. Find the probability that the last point to be visited is \\(k\\), for each \\(k\in\\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\\}\\).

Let \\(p_k\\) be the probability that the last point to be visited is \\(k\\), where \\(k\in\\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\\}\\). Obviously \\(p_0 = 0\\) since that is where we begin. 

As a primer, we can first find \\(p_1\\). The walk visits \\(1\\) last iff the walk visits \\(n-1, n-2, \ldots, 2\\) in an anticlockwise order before \\(1\\). If we unroll this onto a number line, this is equivalent to the probability that an origin starting symmetric random walk visits \\(-(n-2)\\) before \\(1\\). Using the result from Random Walks I, \\(p_1 = \frac{1}{n-1}\\). By symmetry, we can conclude that \\(p_{n-1} = p_1 = \frac{1}{n-1}\\).

Now, suppose \\(k\in \\{2, 3, \ldots n-2\\}\\). If \\(k\\) is to be visited last, the walk can either travel clockwise to \\(k-1\\) before reaching \\(k+1\\), and then anti-clockwise to \\(k+1\\) before \\(k\\), or vice versa. Denote the first event by \\(A_k\\) and the second by \\(B_k\\). For convenience, define \\(E_{a,b}\\) as the event that a random walk starting at the origin reaches \\(b\\) before \\(-a\\) where \\(a,b\\) are positive integers. Again, if we unroll the random walk, we notice that \\(A_k\\) is essentially \\(E_{n-k-1, k-1}\cap E^{\complement}_{n-2, 1}\\), where these events are indepednent. Since \\(A_k\\) and \\(B_k\\) are disjoint, 

$$
    \begin{align*}
        p_k 
        & = \Pr(A_k)  + \Pr(B_k) \\
        & = \Pr(E_{n-k-1, k-1}) \Pr(E^{\complement}_{n-2, 1}) + \Pr(E^{\complement}_{n-k-1, k-1}) \Pr(E^{\complement}_{n-2, 1}) \quad\text{by symmetry} \\
        & =  \frac{k-1}{n-2}\frac{1}{n-1} + \frac{n-k-1}{n-2}\frac{1}{n-1}\\
        & = \frac{1}{n-1}.
    \end{align*}
$$

It follows that the distribution of the last digit visited is uniform on \\(\\{1,2,\ldots, n-1\\}\\).
